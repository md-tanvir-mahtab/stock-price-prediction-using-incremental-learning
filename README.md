# stock-price-prediction-using-incremental-learning
In this project closing prices of several stocks have been predicted using the techniques of incremental learning. More specifically, the multiple linear regression model has been used on an incremental learning setting in order to predict the daily closing prices of six organizations (Dhaka bank, BRAC bank, BEXIMCO pharma, ACME laboratories, Aramit cement and Confidence cement) enlisted in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Here, total three years of data (2017 to 2019) have been used for learning and prediction purposes.  Data Source: https://www.dsebd.org/
